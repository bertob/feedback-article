## General Recommendations
When it comes to designing general purpose interfaces to be used by people without extensive experience with this or similar systems, feedback

* Use direct manipulation and inverse action reversibility whenever possible
* Provide feedback at every level, can make up for lack of DM and IAR but never ideal

## Structure

1. Introduction
  * motivation
  * zoom example

2. Theoretical Background
  * motivate why feedback is good
  * reference AUP, ZUI, Direct Manipulation

3. Taxonomy
  * breakdown of every category

4. Application
  * Examples for applying the taxonomy edge cases
  * Possible improvements for each example
  * hyperlink -> hovercard
  * overview/detail -> semantic mail
  * ctrl-c -> visualize clipboard

5. Future work
  * semantic interaction
